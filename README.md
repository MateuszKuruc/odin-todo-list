# odin-todo-list
To-do list app built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.


üåê [To-do list app live](https://mateuszkuruc.github.io/odin-todo-list/)
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
The aim is to create an app that will allow the user to create separate projects and assign individual task ('todo' items) to them.
</p>
<p>
The app has got the option to set 'due date' for each item and provide them with basic details like title, description or priority. To allow date management the date-fns library was used.
</p>
<p>All the tasks created by user are saved to local storage, which allows them to come back to their task at a later date (provided that they use the same device and browser). This is the first time that I decided to introduce local storage and it made me learn more about how data is passed in web apps.</p>

  <li>Add, update and delete to-do tasks</li>
  <li>Set due date for tasks</li>

</ul>
